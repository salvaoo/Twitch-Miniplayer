# Twitch Miniplayer

Are you tired of missing the best of your streamer because of ads? With this extension we help you stay immersed in the stream even when these annoying ads appear. 

Twitch added a small player while these ads are playing, we turn on the volume of this player and mute the ads so you don't lose immersion in the stream.

*You can chose between mute ads or not on the extension*

## Installation

1. Clone or [download](https://github.com/salvaoo/Twitch-Miniplayer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repository.
2. Go to chrome, click in "Extensions" (top right) and "Manage Extensions" (bottom).
3. Click "Load unpacked" option.
4. Select the folder donwloaded in step 1 (if you downloaded it, remember unzip).
5. the extension should be installed in your browser!! :tada:

Now you can watch your favourite streamer and follow the live stream even when those ads come on :raised_hands: :raised_hands:
